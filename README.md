# Caleb's homebrew forumla

Repo to hold custom homebrew formula that I use

Temporarily used toolchains from: https://thinkski.github.io/osx-arm-linux-toolchains/

These are built using crosstool ng. I will eventually build these myself and host as releases here, able to be installed via brew formulas in this repo.
